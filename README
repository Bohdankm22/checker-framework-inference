Checker Framework Inference README
==================================

This project aims to provide a general type inference framework
for the Checker Framework.
There are still some rough edges in the code; it is currently being
refactored, trimmed, and extended at the same time to work with
multiple type systems. This might have created some inconsistencies
and more debugging output than desired.
The documentation of the source code is currently minimal and there is
no developer manual yet.

All suggestions for improvements are very welcome!

If you want to extend the framework for your own type system or add
additional constraint solvers, please send me a mail!


Installation
------------

You will need a JDK and Scala environment.
I usually use OpenJDK 7 and Scala 2.9.

Install the source-versions of these three tools:

http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/
http://types.cs.washington.edu/annotation-file-utilities/
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/

Put all of them into a common directory.
Make sure that all tools are compiled correctly and that all Checker
Framework test cases work.

You will now need to install a type system to infer. Try the Generic
Universe Type system first and then adapt it to your own type system.

All the projects are easy to use from Eclipse. Create one workspace
for all projects and import the existing project configurations.
Contributions of make, Ant, and Maven scripts would be greatly
appreciated.
